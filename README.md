# School Day Calculator

ðŸ”— - https://aatalon.github.io/schoolday.github.io/

## Information

This project was created for my friend Abdo to calculate which period he would have to attend school, depending on whether it's an odd or even day. This resource only works if your school is based on a Day 1 or Day 2 schedule of an odd or even date; this may vary between certain schools.

## Credits

This project was created entirely by me and was coded entirely by me. It was created and published on `1/5/2025` and was my first ever published project on this GitHub account. You may use any of the resources, and it is fully open-sourced.
